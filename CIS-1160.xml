    <description>This course is intended to be a gentle introduction to writing programs in a
      Windows environment. It will be taught using the C programming language, but will focus
      primarily on concepts such as variable declarations, if statements, and loops that are
      common to most popular programming languages. Students are not required to have more than
      a rudimentary knowledge of the Windows operating system, so the first part of the course
      will also teach students how to manage files and directories, run programs, edit text
      files, and use a compiler. The purpose of the course is to give students in the 3-year,
      computer and electrical engineering technology programs a head start so that they are not
      overwhelmed at the beginning of CIS-2025. It is also open to other students, especially
      engineering students, who would like an introduction to programming.</description>
