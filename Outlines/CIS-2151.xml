    <description>This course introduces the student to network protocols. The course covers
      physical, data link, network, transport, and application layer protocols. The TCP/IP
      protocol suite is discussed in detail. Topics include Ethernet, connectionless protocols,
      connection oriented protocols, and application protocols such as DNS, DHCP, and HTTP.
      Students learn about both hardware and software troubleshooting tools, security issues,
      and current topics such as IPv6. Hands-on experience working with networking equipment and
      use of network simulation tools is used throughout the course.</description>

    <summary>The laboratories are designed to enhance the student's understanding of the lecture
      topics. Wherever possible, students get hands-on exposure to equipment referenced in
      lecture and currently in use in industry. Students learn problem solving and teamwork by
      overcoming challenges that arise when confronted with real-world situations. Students
      enhance their technical writing skills by completing a written report on each
      lab.</summary>
