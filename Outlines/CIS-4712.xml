    <summary>Most of the laboratory time is to provide the students the time to execute their
      projects as they see fit. A few laboratory periods are used for instructional
      demonstrations, group activities, or presentation rehearsal. The instructors make
      themselves available for consultation on hardware, software, interfacing, or systems
      issues during the laboratory time.</summary>
