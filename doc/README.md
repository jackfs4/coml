COML Documentation
==================

This files in this folder contain various documents relevant to the development of COML. Note
that COML was developed primarly for use at Vermont Technical College. However, it is fairly
general and should be usable at a variety of schools (perhaps with some adaption).

The file 'OutlineStandard-Template.odt' is an ODF template in the format desired by the VTC
administration. It is intended to serve as a guide for creating a COML->ODF transformation. Note
that the template could use some clean-up. It current defines more styles and fonts than are
necessary.
